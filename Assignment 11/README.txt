Problem 3 (Region Merging, Toboggan Watershed Segmentation)

a) We apply region merging for various values of threshold T. For house.pgm, we see that as we increase the threhold T as T = {5,10,11,12,13,14,15,20}, we see that for low T values ie. T = 5, there has hardly been any merging and so, there are far too many segments which have differences in gray values above the threshold T = 5. For higher threshold values T = {11,12,13,14,15,20}, there has been too much merging due to which we lose important segments and boundaries which is again undesirable. We get the most reasonable result for T = 10 for which we don't lose important segments/boundaries but at the same time don't suffer from over-segmentation. For trui.pgm, we get similar results where we get over-segmentation for T = 3 and loss of boundaries/segments for T = {5,6,7,10,15,20}. We get reasonable result for T = 4 for trui.pgm. Overall, the general observation is that if threshold is set too small, we suffer from over-segmentation and get unnecessary/spurious details/segments and if we set the threshold too large, we lose important segments and boundaries. Hence, an intermediate value by carefully checking for various thresholds should be chosen for optimal segmentation. 

b) Here, we apply Watershed segmentation for various values of sigma for house.pgm and trui.pgm. For sigma = 0, for both house.pgm and trui.pgm, we don't smooth presmooth our image and so, small variations in gray values due to noise/quantization get picked up as local minima/basins which results in over-segmentation. For house.pgm, the segmentation is better for sigma = 3 compared to sigma = 0 but there is still a bit of over-segmentation. sigma = {5,7} resolves the problem of over-segmentation but boundaries/edges are over-smoothed and distorted and we get delocalised structures. Similarly, for trui.pgm, the segmentation is better for sigma = {3,5} compared to sigma = 0 but there is still a bit of over-segmentation. sigma = {7,9} resolves the problem of over-segmentation further but again, the boundaries/edges are over-smoothed and distorted and we get delocalised structures, especially in the neck pattern of the scarf. Overall, we observe that for lower sigma values, we tend to get over-segementation while for higher sigma values, the boundaries/edges are over-smoothed and distorted and we get delocalised structures.
