Problem 4

b) We can see that gamma values from 0.45 to 0.55 give reasonable results. The original image asbest.pgm is pale and has low contrast. This means that we have to enhance the contrast of the original image which gives us a hint that gamma should have value less than 1 (As gamma less than 1 enhances contrast and gamma greater than 1 diminishes contrast). After trying with a range of gamma values from 0.2 to 0.6, we observe that gamma values between 0.45 and 0.55 give good results visually with gamma value of 0.5 giving the best result. We can explain this by noting that since we needed a gamma correction factor of approximately 0.5, the original image must've been transformed by a gamma factor of 1/(~0.5) = approximately 2. This corresponds to the gamma characteristics of monitors (gamma =2) which transforms the raw image into something that looks slightly unpleasant. We use a gamma correction factor of approximately 0.5 to compensate for this effect.
